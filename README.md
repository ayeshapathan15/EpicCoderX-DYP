   ```

## ðŸ’» Usage

1. **Upload Medical Images**:
   - Navigate to the upload section
   - Select or drag-and-drop medical images
   - Choose the image type (X-ray, MRI, CT scan, etc.)

2. **View Analysis**:
   - After uploading, the AI will analyze the image
   - View detected anomalies highlighted on the image
   - Review the preliminary report

3. **Use 3D Visualization**:
   - Toggle to 3D view to see a three-dimensional rendering
   - Rotate, zoom, and explore the 3D model
   - Use cross-sectional views for detailed examination

4. **Compare Reports**:
